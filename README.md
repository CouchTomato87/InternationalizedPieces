# InternationalizedPieces
Internationalized pieces for games in the chess family

This repository contains pieces that I've designed for the East Asian chess games of Shogi and Xiangqi. The design motif behind these pieces is to make them internationalized, but not westernized. What that means is that they aren't just remade with pieces from chess (a tower for rook, for example) just to be easy for chess players. Instead, they're based on the original meanings of the pieces as much as possible, although homage to western pieces is used when appropriate, for example the common knight pieces can obviously share the same horse head shape.
