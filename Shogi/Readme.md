## Background
This piece set is designed to create a feasible standard for internationalized shogi pieces. Many of the sets designed right now are more *westernized* shogi pieces, based off western chess. While accessible to many chess players, a good portion of shogi players do not like the westernization part, often because it makes shogi look like “just another variation of chess.”
## Goal
The goal of this set is to make pieces that can be understood by everyone, but also stand independently and retain their Japanese roots. Although the pieces are *mostly* different, the few pieces shared with chess (king, knight, rook, and bishop) should still be able to be quickly grasped by chess players.
## Versions
Like chess, cheaper sets are available in **plastic**, while more expensive ones are **wood**. Another goal is to make this a fully functional set that can be in both (pictures above are plastic on the left, and wood on the right). And even more, they should be able to be used in **books or other black and white media**. Plastic gives the ability to use colors, which this set takes advantage of. For **computer** use, both types can be used, but like many chess programs, apps, and websites, the “plastic” type of pieces are preferred because of the simpler look. 
 
## Pieces
* Promoted pieces are still red. 
* In the colored plastic pieces, there is also gold in all the minor piece promotions to symbolize their promotion to gold. 
* Although the promoted silver general, knight, and lance have changes, the distinction may not be so obvious in black and white, and so a chevron can be added on top to indicate promotion (note: this is similar to using 成 on top in Japanese print).
* A few pieces are based on Hidetchi’s internationalized pieces.

### King	
王將 *ōshō*

![White Kings](https://github.com/CouchTomato87/InternationalizedPieces/blob/master/pngs/WhiteKings.png?raw=true)

玉將 *gyokushō*

![Black Kings](https://github.com/CouchTomato87/InternationalizedPieces/blob/master/pngs/BlackKings.png?raw=true)

(“King general”, “Jeweled general”)

* Symbol is kept as kanji, and is the only remaining kanji
  * Maintained as an iconic symbol of shogi regardless of set used
  * Of all the kanji, easiest to learn and recognize
  * The “cross” in the middle may also help chess players think of the chess king, which also has a cross.
* Jeweled distinction (玉) removed to keep things simple
* In plastic set, the pieces themselves are black and white to signify the side. The black king is colored gold so that it is not confusing as to whether it's the kanji color or the piece color that represents the side.
* In wooden set, Black and white bars on bottom give actual meaning to “black” and “white” (*gote* and *sente*)
* *Design considerations*: Any font can work. However, a simple font is preferred for plastic style pieces, while more stylish calligraphy can be used in wooden pieces.

### Rook	 
飛車 *hisha*

(“Flying chariot”)	

![Rooks](https://github.com/CouchTomato87/InternationalizedPieces/blob/master/pngs/Rooks.png?raw=true)

* Chariot design is based off the Japanese name
* For chess players, if the wheel is removed, this still resembles the “tower” shape of the rook.
* Also, a historical fact: the word “rook” is based on the Persian word for chariot.
* People familiar with xiangqi will also quickly make the connection, as the rook in that game is also called a chariot.
* *Design considerations*: The pink pieces (plastic only) symbolize major pieces.

 
### Dragon King (“Dragon”)	
龍王 *ryūō*

(“Dragon king”)

![Dragons](https://github.com/CouchTomato87/InternationalizedPieces/blob/master/pngs/Dragons.png?raw=true)

* Design is a slightly modified version of Hidetchi’s original dragon, an eastern dragon.
* *Design considerations*: Any kind of snake-like dragon can act as a “dragon king.” 

### Bishop	 
角行 *kakugyō*

(“Angle goer”)

![Bishops](https://github.com/CouchTomato87/InternationalizedPieces/blob/master/pngs/Bishops.png?raw=true)

* Chess bishop’s miter hat reflects Catholicism, which does not fit the theme of shogi.
* Instead, the Japanese *kanmuri* hat, typically worn by Japanese officials, is used to convey the authority of a “bishop”.
* *Design considerations*: The bishop faces right so that the two opposing bishops are facing off.

### Dragon Horse (“Horse”)	
龍馬 *ryūma*

(“Dragon horse”)

![Horses](https://github.com/CouchTomato87/InternationalizedPieces/blob/master/pngs/Horses.png?raw=true)

* The design is a combination of the Chinese *longma* (龍馬) and the Chinese/Japanese *qilin/kirin* (麒麟).
* The piece must be dragon-like so that when people abbreviate as “horse” they never forget that it is just shorthand for dragon horse. Otherwise, it is confusing with the horse-shaped knight.
* *Design considerations*: The dragon horse faces right because the bishop also did. This also helps to distinguish it from the left-facing knight.

### Gold General (“Gold”)	 
金將 *kinshō*

(“Gold general”)

![Golds](https://github.com/CouchTomato87/InternationalizedPieces/blob/master/pngs/Golds.png?raw=true)

* The protrusions of the samurai helmet (including the gold circle) reflect the movement.
* The gold circle pays tribute to older designs that symbolized the gold general with a circle (alchemical symbol for gold).
* *Design considerations*: The piece itself is gold (in a plastic set), and so is the metal ornament, to reflect the piece’s name.

 
### Silver General (“Silver”)	 
銀將 *ginshō*

 (“Silver general”)	

![Silvers](https://github.com/CouchTomato87/InternationalizedPieces/blob/master/pngs/Silvers.png?raw=true)

![PSilvers](https://github.com/CouchTomato87/InternationalizedPieces/blob/master/pngs/PSilvers.png?raw=true)

* See Gold General regarding movement and plastic piece color.
* The silver moon pays tribute to older designs that symbolized the silver general with a crescent moon (alchemical symbol for silver).
* Promoted silver gains the gold circle on top.

### Knight	 
桂馬 *keima*

 (“Cassia/Katsura horse”)	
 
![Knights](https://github.com/CouchTomato87/InternationalizedPieces/blob/master/pngs/Knights.png?raw=true)

![PKnights](https://github.com/CouchTomato87/InternationalizedPieces/blob/master/pngs/PKnights.png?raw=true)
 
* Design based off Hidetchi’s knight, which itself is mostly unchanged from the chess piece. For obvious reasons, there is no need to change this piece.
* Promoted knight gains reins. This is the only distinction if only black and white is used.

### Lance	 
香車 *kyōsha*

 (“Incense chariot”)
 
![Lances](https://github.com/CouchTomato87/InternationalizedPieces/blob/master/pngs/Lances.png?raw=true)

![PLances](https://github.com/CouchTomato87/InternationalizedPieces/blob/master/pngs/PLances.png?raw=true)
 
* Design represents the a lance/spear on top of a wheel, which represents a chariot. (for incense chariot)
* Note that the images here are not updated. Look at the graphics at the top for now for the updated version.
* Promoted lance maintains the spear and wheel motif, but has multiple spears representing the new directions of attack.

### Pawn
+ Promoted pawn (“Tokin”)

歩兵 *fuhyō*  (“Foot soldier”)

![Pawns](https://github.com/CouchTomato87/InternationalizedPieces/blob/master/pngs/Pawns.png?raw=true)

と金 *tokin* (“Reached gold”)

![Tokins](https://github.com/CouchTomato87/InternationalizedPieces/blob/master/pngs/Tokins.png?raw=true)

* Unpromoted design unchanged from Hidetchi’s pawn, which is perfect. The pointed hat reflects movement as well as the pointed hats certain soldiers could wear.
* Promoted pawn steals the golden ornament from the gold general. Good for him!
  * While this is the only distinction if only black and white is used, it is obvious enough that it would not need an extra symbol for clarification in black and white media.
